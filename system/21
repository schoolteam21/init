#Human users have UIDs starting at 1000, so you can use that fact to filter out the non-humans. Nobody's UID is UID 65534 so we should exclude this one too
#UID 0 is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
