#Explain how connect yourself as new user. (With graphic session and ssh session)

Graphical : you should write "login" command and than debian will ask for user name and password and you need to fill the fields.
Probably this needs superuser rights so wee need to go to root or to have the rights.
SSH : write "ssh new_user@ip" and after put your password, f.e. "ssh new_user@192.168.99.2 -p 2222"
